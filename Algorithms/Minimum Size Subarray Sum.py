# Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of 
# which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

# Use two pointers solution, when the summation of the subarray is less than s, increase the right point until the summation is
# greater or equal to s; then increase the left pointer in order to lower the summation to less than s in the meantime update 
# the length of subarrays which satisfy the requirement.

# The runtime beats 70.41% python3 submissions and memory usage less than 7.69% python3 submissions.
